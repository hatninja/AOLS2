#Spacer rules. These can help your character list look nice and tidy.
#
# Format:
# (Pattern Match), (Character), (Span)
#
# Pattern Match:
# 	The pattern to match. If this rule is satisfied, the server will insert the spacer at it's location.
#
#	- Put in a Character's name to insert spacers after their occurance.
#	- Put in a Number to insert spacers after that specific count.
#	- Alternatively, you can use the format of (row):(column). (1-indexed)
#	  To select pages after 1, add 10 to the column number.
#
# Character:
#
#	Simply, the character to use as a spacer. They will show up on clients that use spacers. Whether they are selectable or not is up to your configuration.
#
# Span:
#
#	The number of times to insert the character.
#
#	- Put a positive number to repeat the character that number of times.
#	   E.g. ("Phoenix, Miles, 2" Puts in 2 occurrences of Miles after Phoenix.)
#	- Put a negative number to have the character repeat until the end of the that number of rows.
#	   E.g. ("Phoenix, Miles, -1" Inserts as many miles as needed until the next row is reached.)
#	- Put in "page" to have the character span until the next page.
